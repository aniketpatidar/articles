If you don't know these tools as a developer, then you're living in the stone age...  
  
1\. Git and Github  
  
Git and GitHub are two of the most important tools every developer should know. They help you handle version control for your websites and applications.  
  
2\. Chrome Dev Tools  

Chrome Dev Tools is a set of tools that come directly into the browser. It helps web developers edit pages and identify bugs in the browser to help build better websites faster.  
  
3\. Oh My Zsh  
  
Oh My Zsh is an open-source framework to manage your shell configuration. It will help you become a 10x developer.  
  
4\. Postman  
  
Postman helps you build API's, test them, and receive data from API's. If you want to see what data you receive from an API, Postman makes it all easy.  
  
5\. Vercel  
  
Vercel is a cloud platform similar to Netlify. It simplifies the way you host your project. Your deployment is just one git push away!  
  
6\. Notion  
  
Everybody loves. Who doesn't? Notion is an all-in-one place to get your notes, to-dos, ideas, and everything else organized. It works like your second brain.
